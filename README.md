Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Nasa Api!


THis was a fun site to make. I was able to utlize an api to recieve media other than text. And I have a personal interest in astronomy this being able to work with astronomical data was nice. 


Optimizations:

It was fun to utilize the date time intput and as this allows users to have a more streamline expereince when compared to habving to type in the date itself. 
However this lead to me realizing that dates older than july 16th 1995 will not return valid inputs. As the date time allows this for the user I needed to put in 
instructions to handle that edge case. It will also retuned undefine if the user trys to put in future dates.
